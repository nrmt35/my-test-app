        """If Arsenal do what, with each passing week, seems increasingly likely then this moment will resound through the years. The best title-winning campaigns all contain those flashes in time that set fate’s course: as Arsenal’s substitutes and coaching staff piled on to the pitch in delirium, the Emirates stands a blur of limbs and faces to an extent rarely seen, it was hard not to feel that Reiss Nelson had conjured one.""",

     Mar 2023 16.45 GMT 119 For some time in the buildup to the opening qualifying session of the
      new Formula One season, there was a frisson of excitement in Bahrain it was impossible to ignore. Was change in the air? Might F1’s wiliest, oldest dog, Fernando Alonso, have a lesson left in him for the young pups of the new generation?""",

    body: """The stage was set and the greatest showman duly showed up. Harlequins like to give 
    their supporters a great day out at their annual Big Game and, sure enough, Marcus Smith produced his full repertoire of tricks to leave England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, in no doubt about his ability or relish for the big occasion.""",

    body:
        """Almost all managerial lives end in failure. That’s the nature of the job, or at least of the 
    way modern football tends to interpret it. You arrive and you win, or you are ousted. And if you win, you had better keep on winning, or you’ll be ousted.
There are very few second acts in modern English football, at least not at the same club. Bill Shankly had one, defeat by Watford in the FA Cup in 1970 bringing him to the belated acceptance that his first great Liverpool side was over and he needed to build another. But that was Shankly, and that was then. Today’s pressures are different: everything moves much quicker.""",

     the triple crown, there is enough riding on next weekend’s fixture at Murrayfield without the need to add to the narrative. Still, the subsequent meeting between the two sides on the horizon – in Pool B of the 2023 World Cup in October – is unmissable.""",

    A final round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational which will see Scottie Scheffler, Viktor Hovland, Tyrrell Hatton, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Max Homa among those jousting for victory feels appropriate. Confirmation that the PGA Tour will move to no cut, limited field scenarios for decent chunks of 2024 has drawn widespread and varied analysis. At Bay Hill, the benefits of a best versus best system are playing out.    """,

    body: """The greatest challenge of sustained sporting excellence is thriving even when things 
        are not going entirely to plan, when the body is not feeling great or when the rest of the competition throws up a surprise. Throughout her storied career, Laura Muir has exemplified those qualities to the fullest, constantly finding a way to perform at a high level regardless of the challenges before her. She did so again on Saturday, producing a typically gutsy performance to win a fifth European Indoor gold medal over 1500m and further demonstrate the supreme consistency that has marked her as one of Great Britain’s best athletes in recent times.""",
